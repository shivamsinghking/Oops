1. What is custom operator overloading ?
2. Why do we need Abstract class ?
  Ans: 1. We can't create an instance of abstract class, complier will throw Error.
       2. If there is abstract method in parent class, then in child class it should be defined. 
       3. static and final keyword is used inside abstract class
3. abstract class vs interface ?
4. We can multiple inheritence with interface, and we can't do it with abstarct class.
